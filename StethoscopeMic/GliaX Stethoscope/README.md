Stethoscope
===========

This project aims to create a research-validated stethoscope whose plans are available freely and openly. The goal is for the bell to cost ~USD$1-2 to produce, and the rest of the stethoscope to cost approximately the same.

Currently, the stethoscope resulting from this project functions as well as the market gold standard, the Littmann Cardiology III.
