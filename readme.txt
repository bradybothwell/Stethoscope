Bill of Materials:

1 x 2AA Battery Clip
1 x Adafruit Electret Mic Breakout (https://www.adafruit.com/products/1063 - $6.95 US)
1 x Stereo Audio Jack (I used a breakout board from sparkfun but it could be done with any audio jack)

Wire (I use silicone coated wire because its more flexible and less noisy) 
Super Glue
Sticky Tack
Small Rubber Band

Assembly instructions:


See Circuit Layout.pdf for an explanation of the circuit

1. Clear out all support from the prints

2. Solder long leads to the microphone breakout board with the wires protruding from the same side as the mic cylinder

3. Place a bead of glue around the base of the microphone element cylinder

4. Slot the Mic Cylinder into the hole on side of the head, lining up the board with the void provided, the wire should slot into the groove around the outside

5. Place 3 small, even sized blobs of sticky tack on the top of the head

6. Slot the wire through the hole in the head shell

7. Wrap the wire once around the head through the groove, and slip the shell down over the head lining up the hole with the microphone board 

8. press down on the shell to crush the sticky tack and bond it, you could also just use double sided tape

9. Place the rubber band around the groove on the cup side of the head

10. Carefully push the diaphragm over the edge of the cup and rubber band, you can use plastic tools to manipulate the rubber band to avoid cutting it but it doesnt have to be perfect

11. Wire up the wires from the mic to the audio breakout and batteries, see the circuit diagram pdf in the folder

12. Secure the audio breakout into the audio port chassis by gluing the strap arount the two sides of the chassis (check out the 3d models it'll make more sense)

Done!

Note: If the gain is too low, there is a trim pot on the microphone board but it also raises the noise level id probably leave it at halfway
